          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>I've worn many hats over the years, but I've found myself gravitating towards technology and its use case for empowering individuals.  How we interact with the very data we create while existing in a system of surveillance is a concept I find interesting in a philosophical sense, as well as a technical one.  Open source technologies as a concept is something I am interested in, and part of what has led me to persue coding.  I am also a big fan of sleeping 8 hours a night. </p>
